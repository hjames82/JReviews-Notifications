# JReviews-Notifications
The JReviews Notitication Addon was developed to help users receive notification's of interested listings.

The addon currently allows the administrator to assign default selection fields based on each listing type. It also allows the admin the ability to limit the number of notifications a user is allowed to create. 

The system currently uses similar styling as that of JReviews itself and many of the same code basis.
